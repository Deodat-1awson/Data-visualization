## by abdulaziz alomar )


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is the name of the bike-sharing system in the Bay Area. Bay Area Bike Share, a pilot program with 700 bikes and 70 stations dotted around San Francisco and San Jose, made its premiere in 2019. After the expansion is complete, Ford GoBike will have 7,000 bikes available in San Francisco, the East Bay, and San Jose.
## Summary of Findings

>The first thing I discovered is that there are more subscribers than customers and that men outnumber women.

>The age of the clients and who is the most targeted age for the campaigns, as well as the user type and the duration of a trip, where we see that the clients have longer trip durations than the subscribers, were the two factors in the data set that I found to be related.

>Last but not least, I discovered through multivariate exploration which day has the longest user type, and we discovered that consumers ride the bike for a considerably longer period of time each day than subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For the presentation, I'll compare the two sorts of users and their genders, and my main points will be as follows: Although there are more subscribers than customers, customers ride bikes more frequently during the day and over far longer distances than subscribers do.
